# housing
Sort students into housing assignments based on their given preferences. Created as final project in a Java Programming class in 2024. 

Developed a simplified program in Java that took student housing assignment preferences (ex. ranked hall preferences, ranked wing preferences, balance of classes, hypoallergenic room, etc.) and sorted students into different residential halls. 
This project was inspired by the idea of automating a process that is currently done by hand at my residential school and is known to be faulty and time consuming. 


# Quick Start
Run the main function from the Analyzer class. The terminal should print some information about where housing assignments and statistics about housing assigmments were printed. 

See housing/README.txt for more information.
